            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jennifer Moser, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Florida. I grew up by the surf and sand of St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
            <p>I am a 19-year-old public relations major at UF, and I am also minoring in business administration. I plan to graduate in May 2015 with my bachelor's degree and a certificate in international communication. </p>
            <p>I have always been very active in sports growing up. For 10 years I participated in competitive gymnastics and played softball throughout high school. Working hard at the challenges I faced in each sport, I learned that dedication and hard work were key in accomplishing any of your goals.</p>
            <p>I am currently a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at UF where I have learned to foster friendships and getting involved with charity work. Theta sponsors the philanthropy CASA, Court Appointed Special Advocates. This philanthropy helps children who get lost in the court system, whether it be with donations or by having volunteers sponsor children in court.</p>
            <p>Throughout this website I will provide links to my social media pages as well as a copy of my resume and works that I've had published. Thank you.</p>
