<h2>Affordable Care Act</h2>
            <p>Though the bill was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, the website where Americans can sign up for the healthcare provided by the bill was launched October 2013.</p>
            <p>With this launch has come backlash from many people, supporters and nonsupporters alike.</p>
            <p>"Everyone's worrying over the website now, but it'll get fixed eventually," said Charlotte Smith, Political Executive Director for Pinellas County. "It's what will happen after this has been in place for a few years that's important.</p>
            <p>Smith is outspoken over her lack of support for the bill and our current officials in office. She said the website not working is a clear sign that the government "can't do things as well as the free market."</p>
            <p>Before Smith was the political executive director of Pinellas County, she was the political executive director for the state of Alabama for 3 years. She has been the director for Pinellas County for 3 years.</p>
            <p>According to Medicaid.gov, the Affordable Care Act provides Americans with better health security. The health insurance reforms will exand coverage, lower health care costs and enhance the quality of care for all Americans.</p>
            <p>Many Americans, including Smith do not believe this to be the case.</p>
            <p>"More people have lost their insurance coverage since this bill has been enacted than people have gained insurance," Smith said. "Thousands of people have recieved letters saying their insurance has been cancelled because the bill makes all policies a one-size-fits-all. I'm above the age of fertility, but my health insurance according to the bill says I need coverage for birth control."</p>
            <p>But not everyone feels the same as Smith. Many Americans have already signed up for health insurance through the website despite its many problems. And even more are still waiting to sign up with the site.</p>
            <p>According to the Affordable Care Act's website, HealthCare.gov, if participants sign uop for coverage by Dec. 23, they will receive that coverage as soon as Jan. 1.</p>
            <p>The ACA encourages all Americans to sign up, including those with preexisting conditions and the younger voting population.</p>
            <p>Smith said this may sound good, but in practice the government will redistribute nearly one-sixth of funding for the public sector to cover the costs for the health care. But this isn't the only money they'll be using to fund the bill. Starting January 2014, there will be a 3 percent added federal tax on all housing sales to help contribute to the fund.</p>
            <p>"There is no way to financially support this in the long run," Smith said. "And I don't think that's what Obama's plan even is. When he was first seeking the presidency in the 2008 election he was interviewed saying that he eventually wants to see universal, single payer health care like they have in Europe. But he said it had to be a progessional thing because the American people wouldn't jump right into something like that."</p>
            <p>According to Smith, 80 percent of Americans were satisfied with their health care, but with the bill those people are losing their coverage or it's becoming more expensive. And for those who don't have the coverage, they will be fined each year they continue not to be covered.</p>
            <p>"I hope against hope that it's going to fall on its face so badly that people are going to wake up and realize we need a change [in government," Smith said. "But I don't think that's going to happen."</p>
